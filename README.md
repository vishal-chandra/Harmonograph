# Harmonograph

## Background
A harmonograph is a mechanical apparatus that employs pendulums to create a geometric image. The drawings created typically are Lissajous curves, or related drawings of greater complexity. Hugh Blackburn, a professor of mathematics at the University of Glasgow, is commonly believed to be the official inventor.<sup>1</sup>
